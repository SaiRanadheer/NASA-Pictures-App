# Compatibility
* Minimum Android SDK: requires a minimum API level of 23.
* Compile Android SDK: requires you to compile against API 23 or later.

# Build
Building Glide with gradle is fairly straight forward:

```
git clone https://github.com/SaiRanadheer/NASA-Pictures-app
cd NASA-Pictures-app
./gradlew jar
```

Note: Make sure your Android SDK has the Android Support Repository installed, and that your $ANDROID_HOME environment variable is pointing at the SDK or add a local.properties file in the root project with a sdk.dir=... line.

# Samples
Follow the steps in the [Build](https://github.com/SaiRanadheer/NASA-Pictures-app#build) section to set up the project and then:
You may also find precompiled APKs on the [releases page](https://github.com/SaiRanadheer/NASA-Pictures-App/releases).

# Development
Follow the steps in the [Build](https://github.com/SaiRanadheer/NASA-Pictures-app#build) section to setup the project and then edit the files however you wish. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) cleanly imports both NASA Pictures Appâ€™s source and tests and is the recommended way to work with Glide.
To open the project in Android Studio:
Go to File menu or the Welcome Screen
Click on Open...
Navigate to Glide's root directory.
Select setting.gradle
